Age Distribution Histogram

Project Description:
This project demonstrates how to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable—Age—using a histogram in Python. The Matplotlib library is used to display how age values are spread across different age ranges within a population.

Objective:
To understand histogram-based data visualization
To represent age distribution in a clear graphical format
To learn the basic usage of the Matplotlib library

Tools & Technologies Used:
Python
Matplotlib library

Dataset Used:
The dataset consists of sample age values representing individuals from a population:
16, 22, 25, 32, 35, 40, 35, 50, 45, 60, 23, 37, 32, 37, 42, 27, 52, 27, 62, 28

Concepts Covered:
Histogram visualization
Continuous variable representation
Data grouping using bins

How to Run the Program:
Install Python on your system
Install the Matplotlib library
Open and execute the notebook file: SCT_DS_1.ipynb
